Have you ever noticed the 1RM calculators posted on the internet overestimate your true 1RM? These calculators use a formula that is clearly wrong!
- 1) They do not consider individuals and their ability to handle uncomfortable weight
- 2) The formula is biased adding too much weight


Well I have a solution for you.....

Example - How it works
========================================================



Consider this example, 2 months ago you did a backsquat of 315lbs. Yesterday, you had a 5RM PR of 295lbs, so you're curious what you're new estimated 1RM would be.

My calculators estimated 1RM would be:                    

                    324.6666667

And this is what the other calculators would estimate:
                        
                    344.1666667

What is this wonderful formula?
========================================================


The Median of:

  - Weight + Weight x (Reps - 1) x .033

  - Your estimated 1RM


Where Can I find this sweet Calculator?!?!
